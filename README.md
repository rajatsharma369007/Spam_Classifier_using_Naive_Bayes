# Spam Classifier using Naive Bayes

## Introduction
Naive Bayes is a classification technique based on bayes' theoram which assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature. In this notebook, I have implemented a spam e-mail classifier using naive bayes algo.

## Dataset
Have a look at the dataset [link](https://github.com/rajatsharma369007/Spam_Classifier_using_Naive_Bayes/blob/master/SMSSpamCollection)  
Dataset contains first columns as classification label and second column is the e-mail content.
